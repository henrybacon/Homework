1. Previousmilis is a method of keeping tabs on two functions or classes happening at different times or intervals. The delay feature can accidentally shut down function. Previousmilis cant really do this because it ocansially checks for what it needs to activate. 

2. It is calculating the time passed since the LED has been switched on. If the time is greater or equal to the set LED delay then the LED will switch flips. 

then i got lost. im bad at this class
